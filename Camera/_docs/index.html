<p><a name="requirements"><b>Requirements</b></p>

<p>This requires Android 4.0 or better. I've tested this successfully on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Asus Nexus 7 (2013),
running Android 4.3. The auto-stabilise feature may not be available if the app deems there is not enough memory (RAM) available
(technical explanation: requires 128MB of "large heap").</p>

<p>Note that I've had reports of problems on CyanogenMod (CM11) - unfortunately I don't have any CM11 devices to test on,
and CyanogenMod doesn't appear to offer any means of testing without a real device (e.g., no emulator AVD images, no
remote device testing), so I have no way of supporting this.</p>

<p><a name="quickstart"><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<p>Simply point, and press the blue camera icon <img src="take_photo.png" width="32" height="32"> to take a photo.
The camera will automatically focus before taking the picture. You can also focus at any time by touching on the screen. If
your device supports focus areas, you can touch the part of the screen you want to focus. Touching an area will also
(if your device supports it) control the exposure level (e.g., so clicking on a bright area will adjust the exposure
so that it becomes less bright). To zoom, use the slider next to the take photo button, or do a multi-touch "pinch"
gesture. You can also control via the volume keys on your phone or tablet - by default, pressing them will take a
photo, but can change this to zoom in/out from the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can press the gallery icon to view your photos
(by default saved in the OpenCamera folder) - it will show the most recent image or video. The gallery button's
icon will also show a thumbnail for the most recent image/video. Note that there is also an option
in the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> to "Pause after taking photo" - if ticked,
then when you take a photo, the image will be displayed - to keep the photo, touch the screen (or take another photo). To delete it,
press the trash icon <img src="trash.png" width="32" height="32">. To share an image, press the share icon
<img src="share.png" width="32" height="32">.</p>

<p>The screen display is kept on when Open Camera is running as the foreground app (if
you want to switch off the display, do so on your device manually).</p>

<p><a name="user_interface"><b>On-Screen User Interface</b></p>

<p>A white square is shown (depending on the focus mode), which turns green to indicate that the auto-focus was
successful, or red if it was not.</p>

<p><img src="switch_camera.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch camera</b> - Switches between front and back camera (if your
device has two cameras).</p>

<p><img src="switch_video.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch to/from video</b> - Switches between taking photo mode, and
recording video mode. When in video mode, the take photo icon will change to the record video icon
<img src="take_video.png" width="32" height="32">.</p>

<p><img src="flash_auto.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Flash mode</b> - Click this to cycle through the available flash modes. Popup
text will explain what each mode is. (Only available if the camera supports flash.)</p>

<p><img src="focus_mode_auto.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Focus mode</b> - Click this to cycle through the available focus modes.
Popup text will explain what each mode is. (Only available if the camera supports different focus modes.) A special mode is "Focus Manual",
which means the camera will never refocus when taking a photo, instead you should touch the screen to manually focus.</p>

<p><img src="exposure.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure compensation</b> - Clicking this will bring up a
slider and plus/minus buttons which can be used to control the exposure compensation. A higher value increases
the exposure, so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures darker. Set to 0 for
the default exposure. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either click the Exposure button again, or click
elsewhere on the screen. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)</p>

<p><img src="exposure_unlocked.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure lock</b> - Click to lock or unlock the exposure.
When locked, the icon will change to <img src="exposure_locked.png" width="32" height="32">. Locking the exposure means
the exposure doesn't change based on the brightness of the current scene (though you can still adjust the exposure
compensation).</p>

<p><b>Gallery</b> - Click to launch the Gallery app, to view the most recent
photo/video (by default saved in the OpenCamera folder). If you get the message "No Gallery app available", then you should install
a Gallery app (e.g., <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moblynx.galleryics">Gallery ICS</a>).
If you've changed the save location, you can "long press" on the Gallery icon, which will let you switch between the
recent save locations.</p>

<p><img src="settings.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Settings</b> - Click to open the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>. (If your phone/tablet
has a hardware menu button, pressing that should also open the settings.)</p>

<p>The on-screen display also shows the remaining battery left (green/red status bar in the corner), and optionally
the zoom level (if zoomed in), the remaining free storage space on the device, and the current angle orientation
of the camera. If "Store location data" is enabled (off by default), then a small "earth" icon
<img src="earth.png" width="24" height="24"> will appear next to
the battery indicator when the location is available (you can still take photos when the earth icon doesn't show,
it's just that location data won't be stored in the photo). A dot shows to the top-right of the earth icon to
indicate the accuracy (green for accurate, yellow for less accurate). If the location isn't available, a red dash will be shown through the earth icon.</p>

<p><a name="auto_stabilise"><b>Auto-stabilise feature</b></p>

<p>All Android cameras will rotate the photo depending on the orientation of the camera, but only to the nearest 90 degrees - so the
photos look right whether you hold the device in "portrait" or "landscape" mode. But Open Camera has the option to rotate the
photos so they are perfectly level, so your shots come out looking perfectly level every time!</p>

<p><img src="auto_stabilise_image_20131009.jpg" title="Screenshots demonstrating auto-stabilise"></p>

<p>The above shows a rather exaggerated example - in practice, you can probably take better photos, but this feature ensures they
come out perfectly level, without you having to edit them afterwards in a photo editor. Of course you won't always want this -
perhaps you're going for artistic 45-degree shots - so this is an option. By default it is disabled.  To enable, go to the
<a href="#settings">Settings</a>, and enable "Auto-stabilise". Note that this feature is memory intensive - it will not be available
on devices with low memory. Even where it is available, the performance of taking photos will be
slower, and there is a risk it may cause the app to fail on devices I haven't been able
to test. If you do have problems, you'll have to disable the feature again.</p>

<p>Also note that the feature reduces the available space in the image - because rotating an image makes it no longer fit into a
rectangular image, so we have to crop it. So it's still advisable to try to hold the camera reasonably level when using this
feature.</p>

<p><a name="settings"><b>Settings</b></p>

<p><b>Camera Effects:</b></p>

<p><b>Apply a color effect</b> - Choose a color effect to apply. (Only available if the camera supports color effects.)</p>

<p><b>Apply a scene mode</b> - Choose a scene mode to apply. (Only available if the camera supports scene modes.)</p>

<p><b>Set the white balance</b> - Choose a method to control how the white balance is set. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">here</a> for an explanation of white balance. (Only
available if the camera supports different white balance settings.)</p>

<!--<p><b>Set the exposure compensation</b> - A higher value increases the exposure,
so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures
darker. Set to 0 for the default exposure. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)</p>-->

<p><b>Set the ISO</b> - A higher ISO setting means the camera is more sensitive to light, though may also result in more
noise. This mimics the film speed on traditional film cameras. Note that this setting may not be supported on all cameras.
See <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings">here</a> for more details on ISO.</p>

<p><b>Auto-stabilise</b> - Enable the auto-stabilise features for photos (see <a href="#auto_stabilise">above</a>). (Only available
if the device has enough memory.)</p>

<p><b>Lock photo/video orientation</b> - Normally the orientation of the photo/video will be rotated by some multiple of
90 degree such that the orientation looks right - e.g. if your device is held in portrait, the resultant image/video will
be in portrait. This option allows fixing the camera to either be in portrait or landscape. Note that if auto-stabilise
is also enabled, it will have the effect of aligning photos to the nearest 90 degrees.</p>

<p><b>Face detection</b> - If this is enabled, then the camera will automatically try to detect faces, and use
them for the focus, metering (exposure) and white balance. Faces will be drawn as yellow squares when detected.
Note that if this option is enabled, then you will not be able to touch to manually select the focus area, and
the white balance option will have no effect (since the face recognition will be used to determine these).</p>

<p><b>Camera Controls:</b></p>

<p><b>Timer</b> - Set a timer for taking photos or recording video.</p>

<p><b>Timer beep</b> - Whether to beep when the timer is counting down, or for the burst mode delay (see below).</p>

<p><b>Burst mode</b> - Take a repeated set of photos when the camera button is pressed.</p>

<p><b>Burst mode interval</b> - Specify the delay (if any) between photos in burst mode. Note that if no delay is
selected, the actual speed that the photos are taken at will depend on the performance of your device's camera. If
a delay is selected, note that this does not include the time taken to auto-focus and take each photo.</p>

<p><b>More camera controls...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Pause after taking photo</b> - If ticked, after taking a photo the display will pause, with options to share or delete the
photo. To keep the photo and continue, touch the screen (or take another photo).</p>

<p><b>Shutter sound</b> - Whether to play a sound after taking a photo. (Requires Android 4.2 or higher to disable.)</p>

<p><b>Volume keys</b> - You can set what happens when the volume keys are pressed: either take photo/video,
focus, zoom in/out, change the exposure compensation, switch auto-stabilise on/off, just change the device's volume
as normal, or do nothing.</p>

<p><b>Save location</b> - Select the folder to store the photos in. Click on a folder (or "Parent Folder") to
navigate through the filesystem. Select "New Folder" to create a new folder in the currently displayed folder.
Select "Use Folder" to choose the currently displayed folder. Note that on Android, there are some folders that
cannot be written to - Open Camera will display a message if you try to use one of these folders. You can also use
this option to save to an external SD card, though unfortunately the path varies depending on the device, so you'll
have to look this up or find it out yourself - it's usually one of the folders inside /mnt/. Also note that
<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/02/17/external-blues-google-has-brought-big-changes-to-sd-cards-in-kitkat-and-even-samsung-may-be-implementing-them/">Google
have blocked write access to external SD cards in Android 4.4</a>. Once you have specified a new save location, you
can long press on the Gallery icon to quickly switch between recent save locations.

<!--Enter the folder to store the photos in. This can be either a relative path (e.g.,
OpenCamera or even something like MyPics/Camera) in which case the folder will be located inside the "DCIM"
folder (usually something like /sdcard/DCIM/ ). For more advanced users, if the folder name starts with "/", then
it indicates the full absolute path (e.g., /sdcard/Pictures/Photos ). Note that folder names are case sensitive.
OpenCamera will attempt to create the folder (and any sub-folders as required) if it doesn't exist. If you specify
a path that you don't have write permissions for, then OpenCamera will fail to save images/videos (and this will
be reported when you try to take a photo or video).-
You can also use this option to save to an external SD card, though unfortunately the path varies depending on the
device, so you'll have to look this up yourself (it's usually something inside /mnt/ - a file explorer app such as
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a> may help).-->
</p>

<p><b>Show camera when locked</b> - If you have a lock screen on your device (e.g., PIN to unlock), Open Camera by
default will show above the lock screen - i.e., if locked, you won't have to enter the PIN to use Open Camera. The
device still needs to be unlocked in order to go to the Settings or Gallery. If you would prefer Open Camera to always
be unavailable when your device is locked, you can disable this option.</p>

<p><b>Lock screen when recording video</b> - if enabled, the GUI will be locked when recording video (i.e., the GUI
won't respond to touch presses). You can use this to prevent accidental presses that might change settings or stop
recording. To unlock the GUI, swipe the screen (in any direction). Note that this won't prevent the video being
stopped if you press your device's Home, Recent Apps or Power button (it is not possible for apps to override the
behaviour of these buttons).</p>

<p><b>On screen GUI...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Preview size</b> - By default, Open Camera matches the aspect ratio of the preview (the image that is displayed on
the phone/tablet's display) with that of the photo resolution ("Match photo size (WYSIWYG)" mode). The advantage is that
what you see in the preview will match what will be in the resultant photo ("What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get") - though this
may mean you will have "black bars" on the display in order to do this. If instead you select "Maximise preview size", then the
camera preview will be as large as possible, trying to fill the available space. However if the resolution of the
photo is a different aspect ratio to that of your device, this will result in the preview being cropped.
(Note that when in video mode, the preview is always in WYSIWYG mode.)</p>

<p><b>UI placement</b> - Whether to optimise the user interface for left-handed or right-handed use.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom</b> - Whether to display the current zoom level of the camera (when zoomed in).</p>

<p><b>Show zoom -/+ controls</b> - Whether to display -/+ buttons to control zoom.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom slider controls</b> - Whether to display to a slider to control zoom.</p>

<p><b>Show free memory</b> - Whether to display the remaining storage space of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show angle</b> - Whether to display the orientation angle of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show angle line</b> - Whether to display a horizontal "level" line that visually indicates the orientation of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show compass direction</b> - Whether to display the compass direction of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show a grid</b> - Whether to display one of a choice of grids on the camera preview (including 3x3 grid,
which helps with applying the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>).</p>

<p><b>Show thumbnail animation</b> - Whether to display the moving thumbnail animation when taking a photo.</p>

<p><b>Force maximum brightness</b> - Whether to force the screen display to maximum brightness.</p>

<p><b>Photo and Video Settings:</b></p>

<p><b>Photo and video settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Camera resolution</b> - Select the resolution of photo images taken by the camera. Note that if auto-stabilise is enabled,
images will in general come out as a slightly lower resolution (due to the rotation and cropping that's required).</p>

<p><b>Image quality</b> - The image quality of saved JPEG images. Higher means better quality, but the image files will take up
more storage space.</p>

<p><b>Store location data (Geotagging)</b> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the current
location, and  compass direction (note that if Open Camera is called via another app, the compass direction
won't be saved - this is only supported when Open Camera is run as a standalone app). Location data will also
be stored in videos (though only for devices that record in MPEG4 or 3GPP formats).</p>

<p><b>Video resolution</b> - Select the resolution of videos taken by the camera.</p>

<p><b>Force 4K UHD video (experimental)</b> - Enable recording in 4K UHD (3840x2160) on the back camera (if ticked, this overrides the setting in
"Video resolution"). Note that 4K video isn't fully supported by the standard Android API yet, so there is no way for Open Camera to
determine if your device supports 4K video. If you enable this on a device that doesn't support it, you may either get an error
message when you try to record, or it may succeed but create a video where the resolution isn't 4K, or may even result in a crash! So
please test this out first. I've tested this successfully on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3. (If this option doesn't show up at all, it's
because Open Camera thinks this is a device that probably doesn't support 4K video - if your device does support 4K video,
please let me know so I can fix this.) Also note that on some devices, 4K resolutions may show up in the list of available
video resolutions anyway.</p>

<p><b>Enable video stabilization</b> - Video stabilization reduces the shaking due to the motion of the camera in
both the preview and in recorded videos.</p>

<p><b>Video bitrate (approx)</b> - If set to a value other than "default", the default video bitrate is overridden. Higher values mean better
quality video, but the files take up more disk space. Note that some values may be unsupported by your device, and may
cause the recording to fail - in some cases, this can cause problems with the camera that require a reboot to fix. So
please test before using. Also note that the bitrate setting is approximate - the resultant video file will typically be slightly different
to that requested.</p>

<p><b>Video frame rate (approx)</b> - If set to a value other than "default", the camera will try to match this frame
rate. Note that this is very approximate, as frame rate depends on many factors such as your device and lighting
conditions, so there is no guarantee that the resultant video's frame rate will match with the requested value. Also note
that some frame rate values may be unsupported by your device, and cause the recording to fail, so please test before
using.</p>

<p><b>Max duration of video</b> - This option can be used to set a maximum duration of the video. If set, video recording
will stop after the specified time (unless already stopped earlier).</p>

<p><b>Restart video after max duration</b> - If a max duration has been set (see above), this option can be used to make
the video automatically stop and restart the specified number of times. So this can be used to take a video for a long
period, broken up into multiple video files. If a max duration has not been set, then this option has no effect.</p>

<p><b>Record audio</b> - Whether to record audio when recording a video.</p>

<p><b>Audio source</b> - Select the audio source for recording video. The effect of this depends on your device -
if it supports an external microphone, you may be able to use this by selecting "External mic".</p>

<p><b>Flash while recording video</b> - If enabled, the camera flash will flash every second while recording video. This
isn't something most people will need, but it can be useful if the phone is being operated remotely, as a signal that the
video is still recording.</p>

<p><a name="history"><b>History</b></p><pre>

Version 1.18 (2014/08/28)

FIXED   Problem on some devices (including Nexus 5) where torch didn't turn off
        until going to flash off mode.
FIXED   Problem on some devices (e.g., Galaxy S5) if in video mode, and focus
        mode is not continuous, and user went to settings and back, then tried
        to record - video would hang.
ADDED   Spanish translation (thanks to Mario Sanoguera).
UPDATED If camera can't be opened, touching the screen now tries to reopen the
        camera.
UPDATED Allow installation of app onto external storage.

Version 1.17 (2014/08/24)

FIXED   Crash during auto-stabilise if unable to rotate bitmap (out of memory?)
        now instead reports being unable to auto-stabilise.
FIXED   Crash if failed to start camera preview.
FIXED   Crash when changing flash mode, if camera was lost.
FIXED   Problem where photos were being taken out of focus on some devices (bug
        introduced in v1.16).
FIXED   "Save location" option didn't work if folder didn't exist (this also
        meant it didn't work when the app is first installed, unless a
        photo/video was taken first) (bug introduced in v1.16 with the new file
        chooser dialog).
ADDED   New options for volume keys: focus, and switch auto-stabilise on/off.
UPDATED Allow changing flash mode while recording video (so torch can be
        switched on and off).
UPDATED Zoom -/+ controls are now disabled by default, to reduce clutter (for
        those upgrading, you can change this in Settings/On screen GUI).
UPDATED Use more subtle/natural colors for red/green/blue in UI; improve look
        of take photo/video icon.

Version 1.16 (2014/08/17)

FIXED   Device freeze when recording video on some Samsung devices (e.g.,
        Galaxy S2, and some Galaxy S3 variants).
FIXED   Fail to take photo if in manual focus mode, and picture was taken
        whilst focusing.
FIXED   Changing left/right handedness of UI didn't update until app
        paused/resumed.
FIXED   Problems with left-handed UI when going to settings and back, icons
        would shift to incorrect positions.
FIXED   When geotagging was enabled, this didn't take effect until the app was
        paused and resumed (or restarted).
FIXED   If zoomed in, then switch camera or app paused, the camera preview
        would reset to being unzoomed on some devices (e.g., Nexus 7).
UPDATED Save folder location is now chosen via a GUI, rather than having to
        type the path.
UPDATED If exposure is non-zero, the exposure is displayed on the photo/video
        toast.
UPDATED Photo/video toast now displays scene mode if not auto.
UPDATED Video toast now displays if audio recording is disabled.
UPDATED Photo/video toast now displays for longer.
UPDATED Improved behaviour of left-handed UI, to make it more consistent with
        the behaviour of the right-handed UI.
UPDATED Minor improvements to alignment of on-screen text.
UPDATED New icon for switching between photo and video mode.
UPDATED Virtual buttons now dimmed.
ADDED   Support for video stabilization.
ADDED   Option to disable showing the zoom slider control (Settings/
        On screen GUI.../Show zoom slider control).
ADDED   Russian translation (thanks to maksnogin).

Version 1.15 (2014/08/02)

FIXED   Crash when exiting settings, if camera wasn't opened (bug introduced in
        v1.14).
FIXED   More crashes due to camera drivers that aren't following Android API
        specs (Parameters.getFocusMode() should always be non-null, but isn't
        on some devices!)
FIXED   If video failed due to error (e.g., hitting device max filesize,
        running out of space, of other errors), Open Camera now stops properly
        rather than thinking the video is still recording. Last video error is
        also stored in the about/debug window.
ADDED   New option to lock orientation to portrait or landscape.
ADDED   New option Flash while recording video.
UPDATED Touch to set focus/metering now works while recording video.

Version 1.14 (2014/07/22)

FIXED   Crash when clicking to switch between photo/video modes if camera
        couldn't be opened.
FIXED   Problem with face detection not resuming after focusing on mtk6589.
FIXED   Workaround for aspect ratio bug introduced in Android 4.4.3:
        http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=70830
        Problem that this caused with aspect ratio with video recording.
FIXED   Open Camera now available as a choice when camera icon pressed from
        Gallery app (Open Camera now responds to
        android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA).
FIXED   Open Camera now available as a choice when camera icon pressed from
        Cover Lock Screen (beta) app (Open Camera now responds to
        android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_SECURE).
FIXED   All available video resolutions are now supported.
ADDED   New "manual" focus mode - focusing happens when you touch the screen,
        but it doesn't do automatic focusing when taking a photo.
ADDED   Support for more hardware buttons: camera button to take photo/video;
        focus button; zoom in/out buttons.
ADDED   Long press on gallery icon now shows a popup of recent save folders (if
        more than one is available), allowing you to quickly change between
        them.
ADDED   Location data now stored in videos too, if geotagging option is enabled
        (only for MPEG4 and 3GPP video formats).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to do nothing (not even changing the device
        volume).
ADDED   Option to lock screen when recording video (swipe to unlock).
ADDED   Option to limit duration of recording video (automatically stops after
        specified time); also option to restart video a specified number of
        times.
UPDATED Significantly improved speed for opening and closing settings (now
        launched as a Fragment rather than a separate Activity).
UPDATED Open Camera now remains active rather than being blocked by a "screen
        lock" (face/PIN unlock still required to go to Gallery or Settings).
        This behaviour can be switched off by going to Settings/More Camera
        Controls/Show camera when locked.
UPDATED Broadcast Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE and com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE
        intents for new photos, and Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO for new videos.
UPDATED WYSIWYG mode is now the default setting for the preview size.
UPDATED Expanded number of devices which show the "Force 4K UHD video
        (experimental)" option (remember, 4K isn't officially supported by
        Android API and this option is experimental - if this option shows, it
        doesn't necessarily mean it will work on your device).
UPDATED Video time is now shown with smaller font and off-centre, so as to not
        obscure the view so much.

Version 1.13 (2014/05/24)

FIXED   Crash when opening settings on devices that didn't support
        auto-stabilise (bug introduced in v1.10).
FIXED   Crash introduced in v1.10 to do with cancelling autofocus on some
        devices.
ADDED   Options for video bitrate and frame rate. Note that both of these are
        approximate settings, and whether they can be achieved may depend on
        your device, and other conditions such as lighting. Also note that
        setting non-default values for bitrate of frame rate may cause video
        recording to fail, if the values are not supported.
UPDATED About window now shows device manufacturer and model, to help with
        debugging.

Version 1.12 (2014/05/19)

UPDATED Improve support for ISO setting (didn't show up on some devices, e.g.,
        some Galaxy S5 variants).

Version 1.11 (2014/05/17)

ADDED   New GUI icon to set exposure lock.
ADDED   New option in settings to set ISO.
ADDED   Displays photo and video resolution etc, when starting up, switching
        between photo/video, and switching camera.
ADDED   About window now displays all camera parameters.
UPDATED Don't display switch camera icon if device only has 1 camera.
UPDATED Always reset to continuous focus mode when starting camera in video
        mode (fixes some problems on some devices).

Version 1.10 (2014/05/07)

FIXED   Preview wouldn't restart after taking photo with continuous focus, on
        Galaxy Nexus.
FIXED   Problems with aspect ratio when not using WYSIWYG preview mode and
        recording video.
FIXED   Camcorder profile was always being initialised from the back camera,
        even when recording video with the front camera.
ADDED   New (experimental!) option to support 4K UHD (3840x2160) video
        (Settings->Photo and video settings->Force 4K UHD video). Note that 4K
        video isn't properly supported by Android API, so this option may show
        even if it isn't supported on your device, and may not work or even
        crash. I've successfully tested this on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3.
ADDED   Option to not display the -/+ zoom control.
UPDATED All available video resolutions offered by the camera are now supported.
UPDATED Picture and video resolution preferences display aspect ratio and
        megapixels of each resolution.
UPDATED Reorganised preferences into new On screen GUI page.
UPDATED Don't change camera settings whilst camera is autofocusing (may help
        problems/crashes on some devices).

Version 1.9 (2014/03/22)

FIXED   Crash on some devices when starting app or switching camera (bug
        introduced in v1.8).

Version 1.8 (2014/03/18)

FIXED   Crash on startup if Network or GPS location providers not available,
        and geotagging was enabled.
FIXED   Crash if specified save folder was an empty string.
FIXED   Don't ever turn on flash during autofocus when app is launched.
FIXED   Various other crashes.
ADDED   Option to not force screen display to maximum brightness.
ADDED   Option to display horizontal "level" line.
ADDED   Support for hardware menu button (now opens settings).
ADDED   Option to display a 4x2 grid (if you previously had a 3x3 "rule of
        thirds" grid, you'll have to reenable it under the Settings).
ADDED   Added privacy policy (for location permission/geotagging) to intro
        window text (needed for Nokia Store).
ADDED   Uses setRecordingHint, may improve performance of starting video
        recording.
ADDED   New About option in Settings, providing debug info.
UPDATED Don't re-autofocus before taking a photo, if camera recently
        successfully focused due to user touching the screen.
UPDATED Display yellow or green dot next to earth icon to indicate location
        accuracy.
UPDATED Display earth icon with red dash through it, if geotagging is enabled,
        but the app doesn't have a location.
UPDATED Current zoom is now saved when app goes idle, or switching cameras.
UPDATED Offset zoom slider slightly so as to not interfere with Google Now
        swipe.
UPDATED Allow greater range of characters (including unicode) for save location
        (now allows any character other than those reserved by filesystem).

Version 1.7 (2014/01/29)

FIXED   More fixes for aspect ratio - the preview display should now always
        have a 1:1 aspect ratio (on some devices this may mean black bars are
        shown, if there isn't a match between the camera's available preview
        sizes, and the aspect ratio of the device's display).
FIXED   Possible crash relating to creating thumbnails.
FIXED   Autofocus on startup didn't always actually focus.
FIXED   If camera doesn't support focus areas, but does support metering areas,
        still set the metering area.
FIXED   Was sometimes trying to set metering areas when metering areas not
        supported by device.
FIXED   If image is deleted after taking the photo, the thumbnail is now
        properly updated to what is now the most recent photo or video.
ADDED   New option to set preview aspect ratio to match the picture/video
        aspect ratio (WYSIWIG).
UPDATED Save folder can now be an absolute path, allowing possibility to save
        on external SD cards (though you need to know what the path is, which
        typically varies depending on device; I am unable to test this, so
        please let me know if it does or doesn't work).
UPDATED Zoom -/+ control now matches the zoom slider orientation.
UPDATED Hide some icons when taking video, as they don't do anything.

Version 1.6 (2014/01/20)

FIXED   Crash when trying to access image or video resolutions in settings, if
        camera didn't offer these settings.
FIXED   Exposure compensation wasn't available on devices if min or max
        exposure compensation level was equal to 0.
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on some devices (if you are
        still having problems, please let me know what Android device you are
        using).
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on all devices when switching
        the camera.
FIXED   Problem on smaller devices where on-screen text overlapped with take
        photo button; the text is now aligned to above the button on all
        devices.
ADDED   Zoom can now be also controlled via on-screen slider (next to the
        plus/minus zoom buttons).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to control the exposure compensation.
ADDED   Option to display compass direction of camera on-screen (defaults to
        on, disable it in options if you don't like it).
ADDED   Option to choose microphone for recording audio (support for external
        microphones).
UPDATED Exposure compensation is now set via a new button in the on-screen GUI
        (the black and white +/- symbol) instead of the settings. Clicking this
        will bring up a slider and plus/minus buttons to adjust the exposure
        compensation. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either click the
        Exposure button again, or click elsewhere on the screen.
UPDATED Geotagging now stores image compass direction (GPSImgDirection,
        GPSImgDirectionRef).
UPDATED Display degree symbol for displayed on-screen angles.
UPDATED Zoom control is now transparent.
UPDATED Filter applied to sensor for device angle.

Version 1.5 (2014/01/09)

FIXED   Crash on Android 4.4 when launching for first time, or changing the
        save folder (issue with creating the save folder, due to Android no
        longer allowing ANDROID_MEDIA_MOUNTED to be broadcast).
FIXED   Crash if failed to open camera after switching cameras, then user tried
        to zoom.
FIXED   Other potential crashes (NumberFormatException on "es209ra" on startup;
        RuntimeException on Xperia Go when taking photo; RuntimeException on
        "maxx_ax5" when taking photo with face detection).

Version 1.4 (2013/12/16)

FIXED   Calculation for focus areas wasn't right for front facing cameras.
FIXED   Exif data wasn't getting saved if auto-stabilise option was enabled
        (this also meant that on some cameras/focus modes, the orientation
        would have been incorrect).
FIXED   "Toast" pop-up messages looked poor on Android 4.4.
FIXED   Fixed potential crash if taking picture fails.
FIXED   Touch to focus with continuous focus shouldn't show red box.
FIXED   Crash with auto-stabilise for some angles larger than 90 degrees.
FIXED   Crash when rotating device when viewing "Photo and video settings".
FIXED   If device was rotated when app was idle, the UI sometimes showed with
        the incorrect orientation.
ADDED   Images now tagged with current location (optional, off by default). Note
        that Open Camera now requires Location permission, for this feature.
ADDED   Option for face detection.
ADDED   Touch to select focus area also now sets the metering area (used to
        determine exposure).
ADDED   Now displays current time.
ADDED   Option to display a 3x3 grid ("rule of thirds").
ADDED   Now displays flashy thumbnail animation when taking a photo (you can
        disable this in the options under "More camera controls..." if you
        don't like this sort of thing!)
UPDATED Gallery button now displays thumbnail of last image/video taken.
UPDATED Clicking the Gallery button now goes to most recent image/video.
UPDATED Made it easier to see on-screen text when underlying photo preview is
        bright, by drawing a background with the text.

Version 1.3 (2013/11/18)

FIXED   Video files may not have shown up properly in other apps, or over USB,
        until rebooting device.
FIXED   Make sure filenames for images/videos are unique.
ADDED   New burst mode option - take a repeated set of photos at once, or with
        a delay.
ADDED   Option for video resolution.
ADDED   Display battery status on screen.
UPDATED Reorganised settings screen to remove clutter - less commonly used
        options have been moved to sub-screens; "Record audio?" is moved to
        "Photo and video settings..."
UPDATED Only show zoom level (if that option is set) when actually zoomed in.

Version 1.2 (2013/11/09)

FIXED   Crash when launching gallery, if no Gallery app installed on device.
FIXED   Selecting a focus area shouldn't switch to focus mode auto.
FIXED   Focus area wasn't getting reset when it should (e.g., changing focus
        mode or zooming).
FIXED   Fixed potential crash on auto focus.
FIXED   Hide GUI options while taking a photo (otherwise problems can be caused
        by changing options, e.g., changing focus mode).
FIXED   Message for failing to open camera was too wide for portrait view.
ADDED   Option for exposure compensation.
ADDED   Show whether auto focus was successful or not (via red/green rectangle)
        even if focus area not selected.
UPDATED Pause after taking photo now defaults to false.
UPDATED Made "toasts" look nicer.
UPDATED Added simple instructions to the intro window shown on first time
        start-up.

Version 1.1 (2013/10/27)
